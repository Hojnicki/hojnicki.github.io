<b> Basic Coding Work in Python </b>
- [XML Web Scraping](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/xml_scrape.py)
- [HTML Web Scraping](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/html_scrape.py)
- [JSON Web Scraping](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/json_scrape.py)
- [Kapsack Packing Heuristic Algorithm](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/knapsack.py) : Simple algorithm that iterates through items and packs a capacity constrained bag based on volume & value of items without total enumeration. 

<b> Basic Coding Work in R </b>
- [Linear Optimization](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/BasicLinearOptimization.R) : Code to solve basic optimization problems much like solver in excel would. 
- [Transportation Network Model](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/BasicTransportationModel.R) : Simple transportation network model. 
- [One way ANOVA testing](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/ANOVAoneway.R) : Code to conduct one way ANOVA tests. 
- [Two way ANOVA testing](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/ANOVAtwoway.R) : Code to conduct two way ANOVA tests.

<b> More Advanced Project Work in Python </b>
- Coming soon

<b> More Advanced Project Work in R </b>
- [R Shiny work for William & Mary's Center for Online Learning](https://hojnicki.shinyapps.io/WM_COL_Dashboard/) : A demo dashboard to show how shiny could help William & Mary's Center for Online Learning see their admission data in a more dynamic way. [Link to code](https://github.com/Hojnicki/hojnicki.github.io/tree/master/WM_COL_Dashboard)

- [MSBA Capstone Shiny Application](https://github.com/Hojnicki/advancedcoding/tree/master/MSBAcapstone) : Using machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we created models to predict the outcome of golfersâ€™ swings based upon live human testing data collected by the client, MyGolfSpy. We utilized R, Shiny, and Python for our analysis and exploratory tool development. Note that the data in this repo is completely made up to protect the client's original data. This application repo is strictly for demostration purposes and to show how models can be trained separately and brought into a shiny application. 

- [Network optimization model](https://github.com/Hojnicki/advancedcoding/blob/master/Network_Graph.Rmd) : Slightly more complicated network optimization model. Model accounts for shrink/loss after the first ring of nodes.
