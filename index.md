<b> Basic Coding Work in Python </b>
- [XML Web Scraping](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/xml_scrape.py)
- [HTML Web Scraping](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/html_scrape.py)
- [JSON Web Scraping](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/json_scrape.py)
- [Kapsack Packing Heuristic Algorithm](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/knapsack.py) : Simple algorithm that iterates through items and packs a capacity constrained bag based on volume & value of items without total enumeration. 

<b> Basic Coding Work in R </b>
- [Linear Optimization](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/BasicLinearOptimization.R) : Code to solve basic optimization problems much like solver in excel would. 
- [Transportation Network Model](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/BasicTransportationModel.R) : Simple transportation network model. 
- [One way ANOVA testing](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/ANOVAoneway.R) : Code to conduct one way ANOVA tests. 
- [Two way ANOVA testing](https://github.com/Hojnicki/basiccoding/blob/master/ANOVAtwoway.R) : Code to conduct two way ANOVA tests.

<b> More Advanced Project Work in Python </b>
- Coming soon

<b> More Advanced Project Work in R </b>
- [R Shiny work for W&M's Center for Online Learning](https://hojnicki.shinyapps.io/WM_COL_Dashboard/) : A demo dashboard to show how shiny could help William & Mary's Center for Online Learning see their admission data in a more dynamic way.

- [Network optimization model](https://github.com/Hojnicki/advancedcoding/blob/master/Network_Graph.Rmd) : Slightly more complicated network optimization model. Model accounts for shrink/loss after the first ring of nodes.
